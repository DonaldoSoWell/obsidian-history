## Highlights
- Obsidian is a note-taking and knowledge management app by the people who created Dynalist, a popular online outliner and one of my favorite tools. They think of it as “an IDE for your notes.” It lets you turn a collection of plain text files into a rich network of linked thought. Get started quickly with this Obsidian notes tutorial
- Developers use it as a task manager, a software development knowledge base, and as a repository for notes, ideas and code snippets. It’s appreciated for its open architecture, extensibility, code blocks, GitHub integration, Vim key bindings, and configurable hotkeys
- Links and backlinks: links transform individual notes into a network of related ideas. Links are created using either Markdown links or [[wikilinks]] according to your choice in the settings. Backlinks are automatically generated and displayed in the sidebar and the context is included. Unlinked mentions are also listed. Follow a link by clicking in Preview mode and Command-clicking in Edit mode, and go back with Command + Option + left arrow.
