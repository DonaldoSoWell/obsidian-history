Free developer tools are the best option for small teams and startups that are on a tight budget. There is a lot of free or inexpensive software, which can speed up the development process and reduce the time and cost of maintaining the software. But often because of the large availability of such programs, it is difficult to choose the best service for development.

It is not enough to take the first program you see and start working in it. First you need to understand what tasks you need this or that service. Maybe even do some research or testing and find out if it's compatible with other software you use and how good it is according to other developers' reviews.
