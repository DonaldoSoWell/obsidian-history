## Highlights
- Obsidian is a note-taking and knowledge management app by the people who created Dynalist, a popular online outliner and one of my favorite tools. They think of it as “an IDE for your notes.” It lets you turn a collection of plain text files into a rich network of linked thought. Get started quickly with this Obsidian notes tutorial.

- Developers use it as a task manager, a software development knowledge base, and as a repository for notes, ideas and code snippets. It’s appreciated for its open architecture, extensibility, code blocks, GitHub integration, Vim key bindings, and configurable hotkeys ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1534711432/20594060))
- Links and backlinks: links transform individual notes into a network of related ideas. Links are created using either Markdown links or [[wikilinks]] according to your choice in the settings. Backlinks are automatically generated and displayed in the sidebar and the context is included. Unlinked mentions are also listed. Follow a link by clicking in Preview mode and Command-clicking in Edit mode, and go back with Command + Option + left arrow. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1534711432/20594067))
- Aliases: aliases can be created for each note so that you can link to them using different names. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1534711432/20594069))
- Blocks: Each page is made up of blocks which may be paragraphs, lists and more. Each block has an empty line before and after it. You can create links to specific blocks or headings using the syntax [[filename^block]]. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1534711432/20594085))
- Split window: Obsidian allows you to split the window multiple times like in an IDE. Panes can be linked so they scroll together. One use of this is to display the Edit and Preview modes of the same note in two linked panes. Another is to open a link in a new pane. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1534711432/20594111))
- Code blocks: code blocks are available and syntax highlighting is supported. Prism is used, and 255 languages are supported. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1534711432/20594120))
- Tags: standard hashtags are supported, as well as nested tags. Multi-word tags aren’t supported. A tag pane can be displayed in the sidebar using a plugin ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1534711432/20594125))
- Folders: notes can be organized in hierarchical folders, allowing you to create an outline of documents ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1534711432/20594130))
- Embeds: notes and other files can be embedded using ![[filename]]. Voice memos can be embedded with the audio recorder plugin. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1534711432/20594132))
- Rather than storing everything in today’s note, create links to other pages and add the information there. A backlink will be added to today’s page. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1534711432/20594171))
- Also explore the Command Panel plugin (activated by Command + P) which lets you explore common commands and keyboard shortcuts, and the Quick Switcher (Command + O) which allows you to open or create a new note by typing its name.

- If you have notes elsewhere, there’s a good chance you can import them alongside the rest of your Obsidian writing. The Help page offers instructions on importing from Roam Research, Notion, Evernote, OneNote, Apple Notes, Bear, Zkn3, and TiddlyWiki. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1534711432/20594176))
- One of the best ways to get to know Obsidian is via the Demo & Help vault, which is activated by selecting Open Help from the menu. Here you can explore what the app can do while experiencing the interface. At the bottom of the navigation pane, you’ll find a note called Start here. It introduces you to some quick places to dive in, some workflow ideas, and links to the app’s Discord account and forums. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1534711432/20594181))
- Panes can be dragged and dropped anywhere you like. This lets you set up the software to fit your preferences and workflow. For example, you can have the graph constantly in view in the bottom left, your daily notes open, and another note you’re working on. Once you have a layout you enjoy, save it using the Workspace plugin. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1534711432/20594190))
- The Templates plugin lets you conveniently add snippets of text into the current note. You simply add these to a specific (configurable) folder in Obsidian, and a number of variables are available, including {{title}}, {{date}}, and {{time}}. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1534711432/20594264))
- Make sure you back up your Obsidian data. You can do this locally with standard backup software or by using a third-party plugin such as obsidian-git. Watch this video for further details and options. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1534711432/20594267))
